### Objective: In this project We provide digital health and healthcare solutions to help common people and health organizations power their care experience and improve health outcomes with advanced analytics

## Tools: Random Forest | ResNet | Streamlit

## Features :
1) Disease Diagnosis - Enter the symptoms you are suffering from and you will get to know the disease you are suffering from, precautions to take, medications and specialists near you to cure the disease
2) Early Diabetes Detection - Enter the patients attributes from the test report and check whether he/she have chances of diabetes or not
3) Liver Disease Detection - Enter the patients attributes from the test report and check whether he/she have chances of any type of liver disease or not
4) Malaria Detection - Upload the microscopic cell-image of the patient and check whether the patient have chances of malaria
5) Pneumonia Detection - Upload the chest X-ray image of the patient and check whether the patient have chances of Pneumonia
Impact : Improving Healthcare, Improving Lives, Bridging the gap between technology and health

## FUTURE SCOPE

The project Disease prediction using machine learning is very much useful in everyone's day to day life and it is mainly more important for the healthcare sector, because they are the one that daily uses these systems to predict the diseases of the patients based on their general information and their symptoms that they are been through. Now a day's health industry plays major role in curing the diseases of the patients so this is also some kind of help for the health industry to tell the user and also it is useful for the user in case he/she doesn't want to go to the hospital or any other clinics, so just by entering the symptoms and all other useful information the user can get to know the disease he/she is suffering from and the health industry can also get benefit from this system by just asking the symptoms from the user and entering in the system and in just few seconds they can tell the exact and up to some extent the accurate i diseases. If health industry adopts this project, then the work of the doctors can be reduced and they can easily predict the disease of the patient. The Disease prediction is to provide prediction for the various and generally occurring diseases that when unchecked and sometimes ignored can turns into fatal disease and cause lot of problem to the patient and as well as their family members.
In future works, we plan to focus on network architecture of the models used in the research to find the driving performance factors. We plan on finding ways to improve the performance by manipulating the network architecture and hyper tuning the features to achieve better performing model. Using this model, we can also predict diseases like Malaria, Disease Diagnosis, etc and web application for better understanding for user or user friendly. We will host the platform on online servers to make it accessible worldwide
